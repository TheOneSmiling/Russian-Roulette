DEVELOPER NOTES

hi this is a small russian roulette game i made for fun in python
to play it you simply open the exe file
remember to answer if you want cheat mode or else game will crash
yes i know its really shitty

GAMEPLAY

Reload refills 6 random bullets, telling you the amount of bullets
Deload deloads a bullet, although if it is empty you'll have to reload
Shoot basically shoots, if its a bullet you die
The total score is 1000 - deloaded empty bullets * 50 - time * 3
the time starts on first reload
